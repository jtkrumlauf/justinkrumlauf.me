							<h3> About Me </h3>
							<p> My name is Justin Krumlauf and I am a second year Software Engineering Student at Rochester Institute of Technology. I have had a profound interest in computers my whole life, stemming from the first time I layed hands on a keyboard. At a young age, I only used computers to play games, however, as I progressed into High School, I started to see the true value in computing. This realization lead me to create my first project, a recreation of Brick Breaker, the game I had played on my father's Blackberry. The project can still be found <a href="http://brickbreaker.co.nf/"> HERE</a>. After seeing the amazing reaction of my friends and family, I thought that I wanted to pursue in Computer Science. However, after arriving at RIT as a Computer Exploration Major (Undecided), I quickly realized that there was much more to computing than just writing code. </p>
							
							<h3> Hackathons </h3>
							<dl>
								<dt> <strong>HackDartmouth V -<i> *WINNER* </i>- April 2019 </strong></dt>
								<dt> Lil' Lexie - The Alexa Rap Battle Engine </dt>
								<dd> 
									<p> Lil' Lexi was made by me and a team of 3 others at HackDartmouth V. Our goal behind the hack was to create a bot that is able to have a small rap battle with the user. We wanted Alexa's response to the user relate to what they said, as well as rhyme and make sense. We achieved this by using a trigram tagger from the Natural Language Toolkit to find important parts of speech, such as nouns and verbs, from the user's input. We then used the Datamuse API to allow us to find words related to the determined important words. Finally, we used a Context Free Grammar to generate two main phrases using the previously found words.

								<dt><strong> BrickHack V - February 2019 </strong></dt>
								<dt> Hapi - The Twitter Sentiment Analyzer </dt>
								<dd>
									<p> Hapi uses various services offered by Google Cloud Platform to analyze the sentiment of certain hashtags or users on Twitter. Our goal while making Hapi was to create an easy-to-use tool that can quickly give brands or users the average sentiment of their account or brand. Hapi also provides the user with other important information such as the most negative tweet, most positive tweet, and number of tweets analyzed. This project was my first introduction to Flask and Google Cloud Platform, both of which I plan to use in the future. </p>

							<h3> Hobbies & Activities </h3>
							<dl>
								<dt> RIT Artificial Intellegence Club - Treasurer </dt>
								<dd>
									<p> RITificial Intellegence is a student run club where people who are interested in Artificial Intellegence can meet and discuss the most current news regarding the subject. In addition, members are encouraged to give presentations in fields that are interesting to them, educating the other members in the process. After joining the club this semester, I have developed a new appreciation for AI, leading me to try to write some rudimentary AI of my own. Artificial Intellegence has quickly become a field that I would love to work in some day. </p>
								</dd>
								<dt> Amature Sports Shooting </dt>
								<dd>
									<p> Sports Shooting is often refered to as an <i>adult minigolf</i> for those involved in the sport. Although not widly popular, sports shooting is similar to Trap Shooting, where one person attempts to shoot a clay pigeon out of the air. However, sports shooting works similar to minigolf, and players go from station to station and are presented with a variety of different targets. My grandfather first took me about a year ago, and ever since then, I have been steadly improving. I eventually aspire to enter an amature level competition which can be held all throughout the tristate area.</p>
