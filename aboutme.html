							<h4> Second Year Computing Security Student </h4>
							<h4> Attending Rochester Institute of Technology </h4>
							<h3> About Me </h3>
							<p> My name is Justin Krumlauf and I am a second year Computing Security Student at Rochester Institute of Technology. I have had a profound interest in computers my whole life, stemming from the first time I layed hands on a keyboard. At a young age, I only used computers to play games, however, as I progressed into High School, I started to see the true value in computing. This realization lead me to create my first project, a recreation of Brick Breaker, the game I had played on my father's Blackberry. The project can still be found <a href="http://brickbreaker.co.nf/"> HERE</a>. After seeing the amazing reaction of my friends and family, I thought that I wanted to pursue in Computer Science. However, after arriving at RIT as a Computer Exploration Major (Undecided), I quickly realized that there was much more to computing than just writing code. </p>
							<p> I took my first Computing Security class in the Fall of my first year and thoroughly enjoyed myself. I was facinated by networks, security, encryption, penetration testing and almost everything taught in that class. I am looking forward to learning everything I can about the aforementioned subject areas throughout the rest of my time at RIT and beyond. </p>
							<h3> Hobbies & Activities </h3>
							<dl>
								<dt> RIT Artificial Intellegence Club </dt>
								<dd>
									<p> RITificial Intellegence is a student run club where people who are interested in Artificial Intellegence can meet and discuss the most current news regarding the subject. In addition, members are encouraged to give presentations in fields that are interesting to them, educating the other members in the process. After joining the club this semester, I have developed a new appreciation for AI, leading me to try to write some rudimentary AI of my own. Artificial Intellegence has quickly become a field that I would love to work in some day. </p>

								<dt> Amature Sports Shooting </dt>
								<dd>
									<p> Sports Shooting is often refered to as an <i>adult minigolf</i> for those involved in the sport. Although not widly popular, sports shooting is similar to Trap Shooting, where one person attempts to shoot a clay pigeon out of the air. However, sports shooting works similar to minigolf, and players go from station to station and are presented with a variety of different targets. My grandfather first took me about a year ago, and ever since then, I have been steadly improving. I eventually aspire to enter an amature level competition which can be held all throughout the tristate area.</p>
								</dd>
								<dt> Personal Projects </dt>
								<dd>
									<p> If you have browsed my website, it is evident that I am extremely passionate about personal projects. I believe that applying your knowledge to real life scenarios is invaluable in developing strong problem solving skills, organizational skills, and is important to help you retain the aforementioned knowledge. Visit my <a href="projects.html">projects page</a> to learn more and feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me with any questions you may have.</p>
