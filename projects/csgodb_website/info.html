      <p> &emsp; Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a first person shooter released in August of 2012 by Valve. It is a team-based shooter where players must either eliminate their opponents or, in the case of the Terrorist side, plant and detonate a bomb. Counter Strike was originally released as a mod for Half-Life in 1999. Through each of its iterations- 1.6, Source and now Global Offensive- Counter-Strike has become the benchmark for player skill and the basis for all first person shooters. </p>
      <p> &emsp; Teams from around the world are constantly showcasing their abilities and stratigies at local, regional, and international tournements. Professional Counter-Strike players have become legendary in the international community, the video on the right, showcases a handful of moments from past events. </p>
      <p> Although simple on the surface, Counter Strike takes thousands of hours to master, even then, there is always something new to learn. </p>

    <div class="boxExplore">
      <p> &emsp; One of the most major additions for CS:GO, skins were released with the "Arms-Deal" update on August 13th 2013. The update added cosmetic weapon finishes that are obtainable by unboxing cases using in-game keys or through random drops. These skins helped form a virtual economy for CS:GO. These skins can range from anywhere between $.03 to upwards of $5,000 </p>
      <p> Today, skins are regularly traded between players for both real life money and other skins of equal value, creating a vast virtual economy. Some sources say that the total value of the CS:GO skin economy is over 23 million dollars. </p>
